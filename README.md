# amazon-sign-in-mockup
-The assignment was to re-create the Amazon.com sign-in page using what we'd learned about flexbox.
-I went to the actual Amazon.com website to inspect their set-up to get clues. I tried to use their colors when I could find them ;)

*I struggled with: 
--making the footer centered using flexbox...
--making a collapsible list of links in the "need help" section under the yellow "Continue" button
 
*I'm proud of:
--changing the logo for political purposes, even though I totally order stuff from Amazon (the keyboard I'm typing on is from AZ)
--using 'inspect' to find Amazon's colors
--finding the <details> / <summary> tags to make the collapsible list
